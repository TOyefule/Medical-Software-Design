# Security 

Security is an especially important consideration when working with medical software and devices. We will introduce key security concepts at a high-level in lecture today.

## Outline
- Terminology
  - Encryption
  - Signing (verification)
  - Encryption vs. Signing
  - "Encryption at Rest" ([AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard))
  - "Encryption in Transit" ([TLS/SSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security))
  - "End-to-end encryption" (E2EE)
- [Asymmetric encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography)
  - "Pairs" of related keys are generated by Alice--one to be kept private, one to be shared publically. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#Operation) about how key pairs are generated.
  - Anyone can use Alice's public key to encrypt a message that can __only be decrypted by Alice's private key__.
  - Alice can use her private key to digitally "sign" a message that can be __verified as authentic (actually sent by Alice) and unmodified__ by anyone who has her public key
  - Two parties, each with their own public/private key pair can share their public keys with each other, allowing those two parties to communicate back and forth securely (used on the internet a lot). [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange). 
  - This type of encryption underlies TLS/SSL, and is used for securely communicating with remote servers. This allows both the client and server to 1) establish and verify that communications are being sent/received from the actual party (and not an imposter) and 2) to have the communications only decipherable by the server and client involved (no eavesdropper can see what is being communicated). 
- [TLS/SSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)
  - Important to ensure communications between clients and servers are not observed by eavesdroppers
  - __Also__ important to ensure that the client can verify the identity of the server (ensure that no malicious party is masquerading as the server).
